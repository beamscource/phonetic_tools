# phonetic_tools
This is a collection of helper functions and scripts that I've written in the years 2014/15 while working as a student researcher at the phonetics labs of the University of Potsdam and the Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics (ZAS) Berlin.

The tasks would frequently include annotation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis of acoustic and other physiological (breathing, tongue, and body movements) data.

My main point from this experience: Praat scripts, although hailed as an easy tool for phonetic research - are incredibly difficult to debug as Praat lacks almost all tools that could help accomplish this task (an interactive console, breakpoints etc). The only way to debug with Praat is to use print statements... But here is a hot tip: Praat's TextGrids are simple text files with specific formatting. You can compile text files with any other programming language faster and easier than with Praat.
